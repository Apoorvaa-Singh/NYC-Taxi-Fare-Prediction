The task is predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. While you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used, the challenge is to do better than this using Machine Learning techniques!

Dataset Description:

File descriptions:
train.csv - Input features and target fare_amount values for the training set (about 55M rows)
test.csv - Input features for the test set (about 10K rows). Your goal is to predict fare_amount for each row.

pickup_datetime - timestamp value indicating when the taxi ride started.
pickup_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.
pickup_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride started.
dropoff_longitude - float for longitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.
dropoff_latitude - float for latitude coordinate of where the taxi ride ended.
passenger_count - integer indicating the number of passengers in the taxi ride.


fare_amount - float dollar amount of the cost of the taxi ride. This value is only in the training set; this is what you are predicting in the test set and it is required in your submission CSV.
